[log entry written 2013-03-08]

* 2013-03-08

all-titles.csv put under vc
fixed typo in header line ("Lanuage")
all-titles.csv is suitable for R read.csv() import

idea: ISBN means worldcat data could be linked in

did
    sed -E 's/^([0-9]+)/"\1"/' all_titles.csv
in order to quote ISBN's so they go into R as text

and removed a garbage '^K' character in just one of the ISBN (in source data)
